Weather Aplication

It is a weather application using a database from the site - openweathermap.org. The user has two options:
- checking the current weather,
- checking the weather forecast for up to 5 days from the current date (Here the openweathermap.org database only contains state capitals),

The user gives the city and clicks "search". The application sends a query to the database and returns information that interests us.
In the case of a 5-day forecast, the user gives the city (Capitals) and then selects the date. The application displayed information on the selected day, every 3 hours.
The application has the ability to remember previous records.
